I will certainly be recommending you to clients. Having talked endlessly about NZ since I got home, my husband is feeling suitably left out, so we will definitely plan to visit again together. Would love to make it for the rugby world cup, but will have to see how the finances work out. Will be in touch when we have a plan. Once again, thank you for making it such a great trip. Best regards to you and Heather.",
